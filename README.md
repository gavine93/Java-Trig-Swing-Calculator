Lab 3: Trig Calculator


This Trig Calculator can perform basic arithmetic/trigonometric/logarithmic operations (“+”,”-“,”*”,”/”, ”^”, sin, cos, tan, cot, arcsin, arccos, 
arctan,  arcctg,  ln,  log10)  with  real  numbers  involving  parenthesis,  brackets  and  curly  brackets.

It features simple failsafes for improper equations. 

This calculator utilizes the shunting yard algorithm for postfix handling of equations. 

CalculatorV1 and CalculatorV2 are the unfinished prototypes of this project.
